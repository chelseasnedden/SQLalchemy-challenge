# SQLalchemy-challenge
## Background

## "Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do."

## In this assignment, I am designing the tables to hold data in the CSVs, importing the CSVs into a SQL database, and answering questions about the data. In other words, I will perform:

---
#### :diamonds: Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration - using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
---
#### :diamonds: Step 2 - Climate App - designing a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.
---

#### How to run: Download the Climate_CPS file into a folder of your choosing (I used Downloads) and open IUsing Jupyter Notebook to see my code and how I solved each problem provided in this GitHub.
